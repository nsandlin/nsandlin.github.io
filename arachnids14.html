<p>Patrick: Laura Ingalls Wilder sites near there; in Vermillion, national museum of musical instruments; McGovern legacy museum</p>
<p>Patrick: we also have a "corn palace"; prehistoric Indian village; Dakota Discovery Museum; Cabela's  & a gun library</p>
<p>Patrick: Mitchell is the 5th-largest city in SD, with a population of 15,254 [2010 census figures]</p>
<p>Patrick: Pierre - pronounced "peer" like peer review - is one of only 5 capitals not on the Interstate system</p>
<p>Patrick: Mitchell is close to Sioux Falls, about 1 hr by car. "Hey, up here, people drive an hour to get ice cream."</p>
<p>Patrick: the 2015 meeting is June 19-23 at Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell SD, which is NOT near Mt. Rushmore</p>
<p><b>Next up: Brian Patrick</b>, who will host next year's mtg in Mitchel SD, will give us a sneak preview</p>
<p>Vetter: on question "Have you ever had a bad experience w a spider? (describe)" some said, "Yes, I saw one"</p>
<p>Vetter: why dislike spiders: scary, creepy, sly; hide in shoes; cost of antivenin</p>
<p>Vetter: why dislike spiders: icky, creepy sneaky & skeezy; jump on you; webs; "they suck"; "they're always watching"</p>
<p>Vetter: UW Green Bay had higher fear of scorpions score than Tucson</p>
<p>Vetter: had high correlation of scorpion scores w spider scores, both decline a bit w age</p>
<p>Vetter: adapted a standard arachnophobia questionnaire, got IRB approval, had Ns of 133 to 208</p>
<p>Vetter: which is odd, since scorps inflict more damage. ... Arizona has scorpions & Green Bay doesn't</p>
<p>Vetter: you always hear about people being afraid of spiders & never hear about people being afraid of scorpions</p>
<p><b>Next up: Rick Vetter</b>, Scorpion phobia vs. spider phobia in undergrads at 5 US universities</p>
<p>Uetz: these males also court more enthusiastically, seeking to "level the playing field" for themselves</p>
<p>Uetz: results confirm that males learn to associate courtship by other males with presence of female chemical cues</p>
<p>Uetz: lab-reared males do th is much less; so what is the role of experience?</p>
<p>Uetz: field-collected spiders pay attn to courtship by other males &, presumably thinking a female is near, also start to court</p>
<p><b>Next: George Uetz</b>, Learning to eavesdrop: experience in social eavesdropping in wolf spiders</p>
<p>Rypstra: these same types emerged in spiders all reared in complex environments, suggesting a genetic component</p>
<p>Rypstra: 4 personality types emerged - nicknamed Lazy, Darter, Achiever & Sneaky</p>
<p>Rypstra: environment here means the size of the container & complexity of stuff in it #arachnids</p>
<p>Rypstra: Another study showed that the environments spiders were reared in determined the makeup of their behavior habits</p>
<p>Rypstra: prev work by Jonathan Pruitt demonstrated that arthropods had personality - bold/shy individuals, etc.</p>
<p><b>First up, Ann Rypstra</b>, Environmental impact on the development of personality in a wolf spider</p>
<p>This last session of #arachnids14 is on <b>Behavior</b>, moderated by Sandra Brantley.</p>
<p>OK, we're about to start the last talk session of #arachnids14 - but this eve there'll be a very fun auction of arachnid objet!</p>

<h3>Monday morning, June 23</h3>
<p>Even to spiders! RT @spiderwrangler Moms are important. Hancock</p>
<p>Ryan Bell <a href="http://twitter.com/spiderwrangler">@spiderwrangler</a> Moms are important. Hancock</p>
<p>Hancock: but still hard to tell if the juveniles are trying to disperse</p>
<p>Hancock: in our test, group spaced out v quickly after mother was removed, & 10-15 days later area shrinks back down</p>
<p>Hancock: so what are the juveniles doing after mother is gone - looking for new one, just dispersing?</p>
<p>Hancock: ... & location of mother served as kind of a hub; but after mother dies that pattern falls apart</p>
<p>Hancock: previous work shows spacing in a social/subsocial web is important to effectiveness of group capture...</p>
<p>Hancock: this is part of a program to integrate math & biology</p>
<p>BTW: This next talk will be the last one of the morning, after which we will unceremoniously run off for the group photo</p>
<p><b>Next: Nathaniel Hancock</b>, spacing of juvenile spiders in subsocial webs of Anelosimus studiosus</p>
<p>Stoffer: & they do seem to prefer what they know, but there is an overall preference for multimodal signal (vis + vibr)</p>
<p>Stoffer: prev work suggested that females would prefer what they were previously more familiar with</p>
<p>Stoffer: the microhabitat may affect whether they are more exposed to vibration or to visual display or both</p>
<p>Stoffer: S. ocreata males mature 2-3 weeks before females, so females have time to form general impressions   before choosing</p>
<p><b>Next: Brent Stoffer</b>, Effects of sensory experience on unimodal & multimodal preferences of wolf spiders</p>
<p>Here is a QR by the way if you want to hear Gladicosa "purr" <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/eajqG766KN" target="_blank"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bq0tzXGCEAAU41u.jpg" title="click to enlarge"></a></p>
<p>Sweger: if we can hear it, predators can hear it, so there can be costs (risks) to producing airborne sound</p>
<p>Sweger: *possibly* Gladicosa has unique potential for acoustic communication, & thus evolutionary potential</p>
<p>Sweger: recorded airborne sound & vibration from 4 wolf spiders. Volume not related to body size - Gladicosa loudest</p>
<p>Sweger: spiders have sensory capacity for detecting vibration but not airborne sound, so why do they make airborne sound?</p>
<p>Sweger: people often talk about Gladicoa gulosa making a "purring" sound</p>
<p><b>Next: Alexander Sweger</b>, bioacoustics & morphology in wolf spiders & the potential for acoustic communication</p>
<p>Cramer: I've come up w a system & started marking them individually [slide looks a bit like a recluse in a football jersey]</p>
<p>Cramer: prev paper said they actively scavenge, but "in all my hours of observation they don't actively do anything"</p>
<p>Cramer: brown recluse meals of choice (in this garage): 1, spiders; 2, pill bugs; 3, beetles</p>
<p>Cramer: "the brown recluse is definitely not living in the fast lane" main activities are adding web & feeding</p>
<p><b>First up: Ken Cramer</b>, who's been observing live brown recluses in a garage</p>
<p>Now another <b>Behavior</b> session, moderated by Ann Rypstra</p>
<p>Great leiobunine opilionid penile diversity slide from Jeff Shultz's talk this morning <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/XZLk8mDktR" target="_blank"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bq0mSa3CUAEf_sv.jpg" title="click to enlarge"></a></p>
<p>Brantley: one change is that the litter layer is going away, & that's really affecting the linyphiids</p>
<p>Brantley: even though sites close, had v diff results; ongoing drought & fire changing forest stand structure</p>
<p>Brantley: the mountain grassland site looks like recovery, but mixed conifer not so much</p>
<p>Brantley: we set out pitfall traps immediately after 2011 & '12 catastrophic fires</p>
<p><b>Next: Sandra Brantley</b>, Changes in spider communities following wildfire in northern New Mexico</p>
<p>Shultz: ...& the practice of grouping species into female choice vs sexual conflict is not supported</p>
<p>Shultz: plotting measurement of muscles involved in forced entry & operculum closing suggests coevolution</p>
<p>Shultz: & some opercula have barriers, suggesting conflict. Sacs & no barriers tend to go together, & seem to be ancestral</p>
<p>Shultz: in leiobunine harvestmen, a good deal of penile and operculum diversity. Some penes have sacs for nuptial gifts</p>
<p>Shultz: evolution via female choice vs sexual conflict are seen as conflicting concept but may be more of a continuum</p>
<p>Shultz: reproductive structures have to evolve fast enough to keep up with speciation, but need to reflect evolution as well</p>
<p><b>Next: Jeffrey Shultz</b>, Biomechanical diversity of reproductive structures in leiobunine harvestmen</p>
<p>Cruz da Silva: looked at web-building vs hunting on water groups; web builders tend to have reduced piriform glands</p>
<p>Cruz da Silva: Hygropoda, Nilus & Neotropical were major groups</p>
<p>Cruz da Silva: 77 taxa, 35 known genera; interestingly Senoculidae came out closely related</p>
<p>Cruz da Silva: pisaurids, known for their nursery webs & male nuptial gifts, have a worldwide distribution</p>
<p>N<b>ext: Estevam Cruz da Silva</b>, Phylogeny of the nursery web spider family Pisauridae</p>
<p>Alvarez-Padilla: keep in mind, collecting in Mexico is fun, & there *are* some safe places to collect</p>
<p>Alvarez-Padilla: in imaging, if you're doing standard views, 15-20 views should cover most of animal surface</p>
<p>Alvarex-Padilla: 14 yrs after Coddington et al. on sampling protocols "I return to Mexico & nobody has used it"</p>
<p>Alvarez-Padilla: only been 12 faunistic studies in Mexico, lack vouchers, morpho species ID'd only as "spp"</p>
<p>Alvarez-Padilla: 4th, comparative online databases linked to papers, 5th voucher specimens</p>
<p>Alvarez-Padilla: 2nd tool is robust tools to measure diversity, 3rd is standard sampling protocols</p>
<p>Alvarex-Padilla: I can tell you that the Platnick spider catalog is the envy of all entomologists</p>
<p><b>Next: Fernando Alvarez-Padilla</b>, Faunistic inventories in Mexico: A comparative approach</p>
<p>Mallis: found precursors of the spigot in very early instars</p>
<p>Mallis: starting in 2nd instar, you see a grouping of a modified spigot w 2 flanking structures</p>
<p>Mallis: We prepared spigots of each instar for SEM. Few studies have looked at spigot ontogeny</p>
<p>Mallis: ... is at a strategic position, taxonomically, for this study 2/2</p>
<p>Mallis: Besides "being in my opinion being one of the most beautiful spiders in the world," T. perfuga... 1/2</p>
<p>Mallis: a lot has been done on araneoid silk, less on cribellate silk</p>
<p><b>Next: Rachel Mallis</b>, Spigot ontogeny in Tengella perfuga: preliminary mapping results on silk production in cribellate spiders #arachnids</p>
<p>Ryan Bell <a href="http://twitter.com/spiderwrangler">@spiderwrangler</a> Displaying phylogenetic trees is always tough for the audience to follow and see. Zooming with Prezi is a big help.</p>
<p>Almeida-Silva: the new family is sister to the Oval Calamistrum Clade & Fused Paracribellar Clade</p>
<p>Almeida-Silva: Our new family - w 26 genera, 13 newly described - is supported by 4 synapomorphies</p>
<p>Almeida-Silva: Macrobuninae, once the biggest amaurobiid subfamily, is now shown to be only distantly related to Amaurobiinae</p>
<p>Almeida-Silva: family Amaurobiidae has been known as a trashcan. Amarobiinae subfamily seems to be monophyletic #arachnid14</p>
<p><b>First up: Ina Maria Almeda-Silva</b>, Cladistic analysis & revision of Macrobunidae new rank</p>
<p>We're about to get started w this morning's program at #arachnids14, <b>Taxonomy & Diversity</b>, moderated by I-Min Tso</p>

<p>Once people became aware of MRSA infections, the number of alleged brown recluse bites reported to Rick fell to like 1 a year</p>
<p>Now THIS is a brown recluse... <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/qgrtwzWZ4a" target="_blank"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BqxkD2FCYAIMFY5.jpg" title="click to enlarge"></a></p>
<p>If your spider has markings or big hairs or makes big webs between trees - IT IS NOT A BROWN RECLUSE</p>
<p><b>Rick Vetter</b> is talking about people's misconceptions about brown recluse spiders</p>
<p>George tells us that using video to study wolf spiders & jumping spiders has taught us that they're smarter than we thought</p>
<p>George Uetz tells us that we can't see out of the back of our head, but jumping spiders can. Also they like to watch videos</p>
<p>J. Andrew Roberts <a href="http://twitter.com/spiderwrangler">@spiderprofessor</a> So, uh, size matters to the ladies if you're wolf spider. Wow!</p>
<p><b>George Uetz</b> tells us that we can't see out of the back of our head, but jumping spiders can. Also they like to watch videos</p>
<p>And now, an audio an audio recording of the brown recluse spider's mating call</p>
<p>We saw a closeup of the spit coming out of the spider's jaws, & then hear the sound the squirts make <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/789BriBcHx" target="_blank"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BqxdbZYCAAAO2C-.jpg" title="click to enlarge"></a></p>

<h3>Sunday afternoon, June 22</h3>
<p>That's the last talk today. Tune in 6pm for Casual Night w Arachnids. Questions answered, lore shared & reportedly a G+ Hangout</p>
<p>Dodson: so, comparing Misumenoides formosipes & Misumena vatia, we see a lot of variation in the relevant factors</p>
<p>Dodson: they have low density, but sex ratios vary, Mating systems vary (scramble competiton vs. scramble + fights) </p>
<p>Dodson: hypotheses all assume males move around more than females. Using 2 thomisid spp, this is true</p>
<p>Dodson: various hypotheses have been put forward, many focusing on selection for locomotory ability </p>
<p>Dodson: as we know, spiders are way on the female end of the sexual size dimorphism scale</p>
<p><b>Next: Gary Dodson</b>, "What's up with the dwarf males?"</p>
<p>Huang: There was considerable incongruence between BAF values & biodiversity results</p>
<p>Huang: set up 180 sampling plots at 8 univ campuses in central Taiwan, counted spiders, inseccts, herbaceous & woody plants</p>
<p>Huang: BAF evaluates land-use surfce types, homogeneous zones & landscape mosaics. We compared that to biodiversity</p>
<p><b>Next: Pao Shen Huang</b>, can BAF reflect eco effectiveness of urban areas? A case study on campuses in central Taiwan</p>
<p>Chang: vegetation mix & spider diversity was not congruent w BAF designation, maybe partly since we only counted adults</p>
<p>Chang: BAF level was assigned by expert based on aerial photos. We measured spider diversity of same areas</p>
<p>Chang: When a city designer meets an ecologist: the biotype area factor (BAF), to evaluate eco effectiveness of urban areas</p>
<p><b>Next: Shao-Tzu Chang</b>, can BAF index reflect biodiversity pf landscape mosaics in coastal areas? Spiders as indicators</p>
<p>Seaborn: Daily max/min closer in my data than in USFWS & wx sta data. So bryophyte matts stabilize temps</p>
<p>Seaborn: also had USFWS HOBO data & data from weather station at Mt. Leconte. Ended up w a lot of data</p>
<p>Seaborn: I put waterproof data loggers under the moss matts to understand microhabitats</p>
<p>Seaborn: Microhexura montivaga is a federally endangered spider found under moss matts on high N-facing slopes in Appalachia</p>
<p><b>Next: Travis Seaborn</b>, Abiotic microhabitat parameters of spruce-fir moss spider</p>
<p>Potts: put spiders (Mermessus fradeorum) in chambers w & w/o sundews. There did not seem to be exploitative competition</p>
<p>Potts: but what about web-building spiders? I picked a linyphiid spider w similar prey-capture strategies & prey animals</p>
<p>Potts: A previous study found that wolf spiders compete w sundews but stealing prey directy from the plant</p>
<p>Potts: carnivory has evolved multiple times in plants. I used the sundews (Drosera), wh are common in bogs</p>
<p><b>First up: Leslie Potts</b>, Interactions in a tangled web: competition between spiders & carnivorous plants</p>
<p>Now the <b>Ecology session</b>, moderated by Kenneth Cramer</p>
<p>Questions about other arachnids also welcome at #arachnids14 Casual Night. Tweet them now to @spiderprofessor for answers  6-7pm tonight</p>
<p>Do you have questions about spiders? Tweet them to @spiderprofessor & they'll get answered 6-7pm at #arachnids14 Casual Night!</p>
<p>And that's it for the behavior session of #arachnids14, where it's all about how to behave to stay in an non-eaten state</p>
<p>Tso: Attacks on C. ginnago were more frequent when only decorations were darkened, vs deco & spider body</p>
<p>Tso: Ariamnes cylindrogaster has needle-like twiggy body. Dummies w tucked-in legs had fewer attacks than ones w legs spread</p>
<p>Tso: Cyclosa ginnaga puts decorations in its web to look like bird droppings</p>
<p>Tso: many variations on theme of spiders needing strategy to counteract strategy they use to attract prey, to avoid predators</p>
<p><b>Next: I-Min Tso</b>, Evidence for effectiveness of spiders masquerading as bird droppings or twigs</p>
<p>Clark: ~90% of toads oriented to courting male, ~60% to walking males,  & 0% to males sitting still</p>
<p>Clark: if toad oriented to iPad, they'd almost always come right up & attack (lick the screen)</p>
<p>Clark: showed toads videos of the spiders on iPads, measured detection latency (time) & attack probability </p>
<p>Clark: we showed videos of courting vs walking males in different conditions to a predator Bufo americanus, the American toad</p>
<p>Clark: we have a lot of data on their courtship displays, including female attraction & unwanted attraction of predators</p>
<p>Clark: the Schizocosa ocreata wolf spiders & their mating behavior have been studied in the Uetz lab for more than 3 decades</p>
<p>Clark: mating displays need to be conspicuous to be effective, but this also puts them at risk</p>
<p><b>Next: David Clark</b>, Risky courtship behavior of male wolf spiders</p>
<p>Chapin: of the game theory models for invert contests, "self assessment" (how big you are) was best fit</p>
<p>Chapin: often the fight ends when one runs away, but size-matched contests more often end up in cannibalism</p>
<p>Chapin: results of interactions show the whip spider is territorial. Next, who wins? Bigger ones w more pedipalp display</p>
<p>Chapin: if it's about territory, does one - the resident - value the territory than the intruder?</p>
<p>Chapin: whip spiders (ampblypygi) walk on 6 legs & engage in agonistic interactions. What do they fight about?</p>
<p><b>Next: Kenneth Chapin</b>, Contesting territories: Asymmetric resource value & assessment strategies in whip scorpion</p>
<p>Chang: White- & brown-clypeus spiders got similar numbers of non-flying insects, suggesting the coloration targets the former</p>
<p>Chang: used hair removal treatment to  give some Heterepoda dark clypeus. White faced ones got lots more flying insects</p>
<p>Chang: Heterapoda has a bright white clypeus, with higher reflectance than its brown body</p>
<p>Chang: some nocturnal spiders such as orb weaver Neoscona & wandering Heterapoda, have conspicuous markings</p>
<p>Chang: we know bright coloration can serve as a lure for prey in diurnal hunters, what about nocturnal ones?</p>
<p><b>Next: Chia-Chen Chang</b>, Conspicuous markings of a night-wandering spider attracts flying prey</p>
<p>Sitvarin: for smaller frogs, those that jumped more tended to be captured more often</p>
<p>Sitvarin: factors most predictive of whether frog would be captured are relative mass & how much they jumped</p>
<p>Sitvarin: captures occurred in about 25% of trials, about half the attacks came from behind the frog</p>
<p>Sitvarin: used cricket frogs, which are ~half the size of a penny, & wolf spider Tigrosa helluo</p>
<p>Sitvarin: Among invertebrate predators of frogs, spiders are No. 2, behind water bugs, an under-studied interaction</p>
<p><b>Next: Michael Sitvarin</b>, "thinking about frogs &things that eat them"</p>
<p>Mukhtar: collembola in "mixed" arena did not differentiate among the spiders based on diet cues</p>
<p>Mukhtar: collembola in arena with wolf spiders fed collembolans spent more time & moved more than those w cricket-fed spiders</p>
<p><b>First up: Muhammad Khalid Mukhtar</b>, effect of diet-associated cues from a wolf spider on collembola, its prey animal</p>
<p>Ryan Bell <a href="http://twitter.com/spiderwrangler">@spiderwrangler</a> Casual Night With Arachnids at the Reese Center on the OSU Newark Campus, 6pm! #science</p>
<p>We are back from lunch & about to start the <b>Behavior</b> session, moderated by Gary Dodson</p>
<hr>
<h3>Sunday morning, June 22</h3>
<p>Thank you @lilyorit for the spider anesthesia question & presenter Sean Koebley for the answer</p>
<p>Answer pt 2: put spidey in Tupperware, waft in CO2, once the legs curl in you have abou 1 min to immobilize it</p>
<p>We had a question about an earlier presentation: "How do you anesthetize a spider?" Answer pt 1: carbon dioxide</p>
<p>That was it for this session, time for lunch!</p>
<p>Herrmann: stressed spiders had lower levels of dopamine, serotonin & epinephrine, &higher levels of octopamine</p>
<p>Herrmann: kept in dry container, then rehydrated enough to collect hemolymph</p>
<p>Herrmann: I looked at water stress. Spiders are esp prone to dessication given their great area relative to mass</p>
<p>Herrmann: octopamine is kind of considered the "fight or flight" indicator in invertebrates</p>
<p>Herrmann: octopamine related to many behaviors such as bee waggle dance, and is released in response to stress</p>
<p><b>Next: Samantha Herrman</b>, "Stressing out!" Effects of stress on biogenic amine levels in wolf spiders</p>
<p>Kozak: this was the first time as far as I know that cross modal integration was demonstrated in any invertebrate</p>
<p>Kozak: they did recognize signals as coming from diff individuals, & went back & forth between them</p>
<p>Kozak: results suggest that they may have interpreted visual as multimodal, as in "ventriloquist effect"</p>
<p>Kozak: the females were more attracted to visual signal than vibratory, but most to combined (multimodal)</p>
<p>Kozak: can female wolf spiders recognize & differentiate multimodal signals, in synch and out of synch</p>
<p>Kozak: in "ventriloquist effect" we combine two signals that are offset - the dummy's mouth is moving more so he's talking</p>
<p>Kozak: wolf spiders can be courted by multiple males using multiple modes of communication (tapping, waving...)</p>
<p><b>Next: Liz Kozak</b> w a behavioral interloper talk on cognitive cross-modal integration in wolf spiders #arachnids</p>
<p>Hsiung: different hues can be created by varying thickness of layers; iridescence can result from interaction w other layers</p>
<p>Hsiung: the blue has periodic nanostructures, while black & brown have no conspicuous periodicity</p>
<p>Hsiung: the blue hairs have a smoother, more cylindrical structure than black & brown hairs</p>
<p>HSiung: colors created by periodic nanostructures (photonic crystals) are called structured colors, can be very vivid</p>
<p>Hsiung:color is a complex feature, comprising light source, absorptive material & observer who can see that part of spectrum</p>
<p><b>Next: Bill Hsiung</b>, Structural based blue appearance in tarantulas</p>
<p>Long: eyes are connected to proto-cerebrum by "optic neuropils," w a lot of diversity in details of structure</p>
<p>Long: spider brains have 2 regions, the sub-esophogeal mass & ptoto-cerebrum, wh handles visual imput & is the "thinking part"</p>
<p>Long: I had to develop a new method to get thick whole-head sections of spider cephalic regions</p>
<p>Long: spiders have more complex anatomy for brain dissection, as cephalothorax is on part w many organs in there</p>
<p>Long: insect neuromorphology & its relationship to behavior has been studied a lot, not so for spideys</p>
<p><b>Next: Skye Long</b>, spider brain morphology (which is very under-studied)</p>
<p>Casem: cells of post-egg-production state seem to use autophagy to return to base state</p>
<p>Casem: tubiliform glands undergo dramatic changes in size & cellular structure as spider enters & leaves egg-producing state</p>
<p>Casem: tubiliform silk is used to surround & protect the egg mass</p>
<p><b>First up, Merri Lynn Casem</b> on changes in the tubiliform silk gland in the Western widow when she is about to lay eggs</p>
<p>We're starting the Anatomy & Physiology section moderated by Doug Gaffin</p>
<p>That's it for this session, we are off to have coffee. Anatomy & Physiology after the break (10:45 ET)</p>
<p>Mr. Belcher <a href="http://twitter.com/kyspiderguy">@kyspiderguy</a> Bell's quote: "Few failures in the life of an organism are as unforgiving as the failure to avoid a predator" by Lima & Dill '90</p>
<p>Bell: and this data was remarkably unequivocal, altho they do respond to cues on the substrate</p>
<p>Bell: in this study, Schizocosa ocreata exhibited no difference in behavior at all when exposed to airborne predator cues</p>
<p>Bell: in prev studies some spiders have been able to detect volatile cues (airborne chemicals) from predators</p>
<p>Bell: succesfully avoiding a predator is very important to staying alive...</p>
<p><b>Next up, Ryan Bell</b>, response of S. ocreata to volatile cues of an intraguild predator (not a web talk)</p>
<p>Piorkowski: prev studies had seen no change in extensibily, which may have been an artifact of study methodology...</p>
<p>Piorkowski: extensibility changed, but stiffness & strength stayed about the same at diff ages</p>
<p>Piorkowski: do silk properties change as spider matures? Extruded Nephila pilipes silk at 4 speeds...</p>
<p>Piorkowski: when stretched, the silk loses water & its inner structure becomes more ordered, It's stronger & stiffer</p>
<p>Piorkowski: the dragline silk has an internal structure of "blocks & springs" w at disordered structure when extruded</p>
<p><b>Next: Dakota Piorkowski</b>, ontogeny of silk tailoring potential: do large spiders conserve silk diameters to optimally forage #arachnids</p>
<p>Koebley: measured elastic modulus (stiffness) & extensibility, both were in line w or surpassing properties of orb web silk</p>
<p>Koebley: the silk has fibers ~ 7-8 nanometers long, never observed before on any silk, wh we called nanopapillae</p>
<p>Koebley: Br recluse silk being flat is perfect for AFM, it's ~6-8 microns wide, 40-80 nanometers high, so very thin #arachnids</p>
<p>Koebley: we anasthetize the brown recluse, restrain it, reel out the silk. To measure we use atomic force microscopy</p>
<p>Koebley: orb weaver silk is a cylinder ~3-5 microns in diameter - but Loxosceles is nothing like that. It's flat!</p>
<p>Koebley: as you know, silk is a unique in the materials world, dragline silk of orb weavers has been most studied</p>
<p><b>Next: Sean Koebley</b>, Brown recluse spider's amazing nanometer-scale ribbons of stiff, extensible silk</p>
<p>Stellwagen: so really intersting from a material sci standpoint: UV just doesn't seem to affect it at any level</p>
<p>Stellwagen: gathered webs in the AM when they're fresh, stretched in a film-development box in the lab at diff UV exposures</p>
<p>Stellwagen: Japanese researchers working with silkworm siilk found the silk protein sericin is an antioxidant</p>
<p>Stellwagen: webs out in the sun all day, how does UV affect then? 3 types of UV: A, B & C</p>
<p>Stellwagen: previously showed how temperature affects stickiness - similar to honey in fridge vs in sun</p>
<p>Stellwagen: and if you even breathe on them, the droplets will swell before your very eyes - humidity response</p>
<p>Stellwagen: the viscous droplets when flattened in lab separate into different materials</p>
<p><b>Next: Sarah Stellwagen</b>, UV-B irradiance doesn't influene the extebsibility of adhesive viscous orb web droplets</p>
<p>Amarpuri: the work has practical application for adhesives that work in humid environments #arachnids</p>
<p>Amarpuri: this showed a homogeneous structure with both salt & protein found throughout the droplet in similar proportions</p>
<p>Amarpuri: using Raman spectroscopy, which relies on shift in energy from the ligtht to study vibration etc.</p>
<p>Amarpuri: the combination of glycoproteins & salt makes the glue viscoelastic & humidity responsive</p>
<p>Amarpuri: the glue droplets are produced by Rayleigh's instability wh makes them bead up, and is viscoelastic</p>
<p><b>Next: Gaurav Amarpuri</b>, on how homogeneous structure of glue-droplet explains the superior adhesive performance of spider silk</p>
<p>Folks, if you have questions or comments on the arachnology research being reported here, give a shout</p>
<p>Opell: we saw that much longer threads contribute to overall insect capture efficiency than we had previously thought</p>
<p>Opell: measuring the tangential force at each droplet to compute maximum span efficiency...</p>
<p>Opell: stretching a viscous thread in a specially desinged piece of eqpt & imaging it showed a parabolic shape</p>
<p>Opell: Bob Suter had noted that engineers design suspension bridges to be shaped like a parabola, see if spiders do the same</p>
<p>Opell: previously they measured relationship of thread length to stickiness & each droplet's contribution to stickiness</p>
<p><b>First up, Brent Opell</b> re-examining the suspension bridge mechanism of an orb web's viscous threads</p>
<p>We're getting started, first session is Webs & Silk, moderated by Merri Lynn Casem</p>

<p>First some highlights from the poster session, shamelessly based on sharable visual elements (not on my "votes" 4 best poster)</p>
<p>And now some highlights from this afternoon and evening at #arachnids14...</p>
<hr>
<p>Also, this eve a talk on Ohio's Hopewell earthworks over dinner</p>
<p>That's the last talk of the morning. We have the poster session in the afternoon, watch for highlights</p>
<p>Jones: the factors most profoundly important to the model were male density & how fast they moved across the substrate </p>
<p>Jones: avg & median for seismic contact was ~10 males w/in period, vis contact a bit less. Was that enough?</p>
<p>Jones: each cyber-spider had its own  behavioral characteristics programmed in</p>
<p>Jones: but hey, there's a ton of data on Schizicosa ocreata data, so we were able to use it & program little cyber-spiders</p>
<p>Jones: there's a growing body of evidence that females get more choosy after seeing about ~45 males in the lab; & in the field?</p>
<p>Jones: as we know, Bateman's principle us that females *should* be choosy, but only if there are more males out there</p>
<p><b>Next, TJ Jones</b>, Female's visual & seismic experience with courting males during courtship, last talk of the morning</p>
<p>Watts: Did not actually see *any* attacks on the spiders in the field over 1600+ observations captured on video</p>
<p>Watts: they are more likely to attack simulated prey at night, & more likely to leave the web hub to avoid simulated predators</p>
<p>Watts: spiders will accept prey items at all times in 24 hr cycle, but at different rates night & day</p>
<p>Watts: spiders confronted w a predator in the web show a much greater variety of behaviors than in the artificial arena</p>
<p>Watts: this builds on last year's Spiders on the Clock, testing classic adaptive rhythm hypothesis</p>
<p><b>Next, Colton Watts</b>, ecological implications of Cyclosa turbinata diel rhythms of foraging & antipredator behavior </p>
<p>Gilbert: males infected as juveniles had lower courtship vigor, less symmetrical tufts, & lower mating success</p>
<p>Gilbert: Males who courted for 5 minutes had lowered immune response; actively infected males had most courtship vigor</p>
<p>Gilbert: we know courtship is energetically taxing for males. Males exposed to pathogens have higher immune response...</p>
<p><b>Next: Rachel Gilbert</b>, relationship between immunity & multimodal sexual signaling in wolf spiders</p>
<p>Mitchell: but more-rigorous tests showed no variations, so thinking may be uses in my design...</p>
<p>Mitchell: using less-aggressive light levels than prev studies suggested scorpions may be attracted to green light</p>
<p>Mitchell: been hypothesized that photosensitve elements in their tails may suggest that the scorpion is "one big eye"</p>
<p>Mitchell: scorpion eyes only sensitive to one type of light (1 photoreceptor type), responce to UV may just be green bouncing</p>
<p><b>Next, Jacob Mitchell</b>, "Glowing Green," - a new test of scorpion light sensitivity & its relationship to fluorescence</p>
<p>Persons: males just the opposite, oriented both to Earth & coils (altho not congruent w dir of field, oddly)</p>
<p>Persons: females showed no signif difference in orientation either in control or treatments</p>
<p>Persons: field was ~5x stronger than Earth's, so canceled external field, red light to minimize visual cues #arachnids</p>
<p>Persons: used the cute wandering nocturnal Tigrosa helluo, and Helmholz coil for mag field</p>
<p>Persons: lots of animals use magnetic cues/orientation, last year there was that study on dogs facing north to poo... #arachnids</p>
<p>Now: Matt Persons, do wolf spiders use magnetoreception</p>
<p>Jakob: Will also be able to do a study w a researcher who can connect the rig to central brain of the spider</p>
<p>Jakob: Michael Land suggested years ago that the spiders are looking for *legs* - will be able to test that</p>
<p>Jakob: when ALE are masked, they stop picking up movement</p>
<p>We're now seeing Phiddipus audax' retinas quiet when looking at a blank screen, vs twitching when looking at a cricket</p>
<p>Jakob: a challenge was calibration, since spiders are not sensitive to voice commands #arachnid</p>
<p>Jakob: salticids have had some tracking work done, & we expanded on that, had to get a special eye tracker built</p>
<p>Jakob: eye tracking in non-human animals rel rare, bec  few eyes move. Main invert one was in stomatopods (mantis shrimp)</p>
<p>Jakob: I'm in an psych dept, and eye-tracking is done a lot, to understand how people read complex sentences or respond to ads #aracnids14</p>
<p>We just saw an awesome short video of the tubes moving inside a see-through jumping spider that Wayne Maddison found</p>
<p>Jakob: main eyes have best vis acuity of any land invert. Retina only 10 degrees but the tubes move</p>
<p>Jakob: salticid secondary eyes have a fixed lens that's part of the cuticle, about as good as the eyes of dragonfly </p>
<p></p><b>First up, Beth Jakob</b>, tracking the eyes of jumping spiders, a window into perception</p>
<p>Starting 2nd #arachnids14 morning session, <b>Behavior</b>, moderated by Jason Bond</p>

<h3>Saturday morning, June 21</h3>
<p>Dear all: If you see a mistake or have a question for one of the speakers at #arachnids14, give a shout to me or to the hashtag</p>
<p>And that's it for the morning taxo session at #arachnids14, after the break Behavior moderated by Jason Bond</p>
<p>Hedin: Some may argue it's a negative result for conservation biology, but I feel it needs to be based on the best evidence</p>
<p>Hedin: results clearly suggested 2 total species, not 4. This is supported by essentially identical palpal morphology </p>
<p>Hedin: genetic data best for this task, used mitochondrial & 8 rapidly evolving nuclear genes</p>
<p>Hedin: Highway dept came to me & asked "Is C. wartoni a species?"</p>
<p>Hedin: Cave spiders tend to vary cave to cave anyway ... there is no known same-cave sympatry among cave spiders</p>
<p>Hedin: C. wartoni is in a complex of 4 spp, described by Gertsch based on epiginal morphology</p>
<p>Hedin: Cicurina wartoni described from a single adult female found in a small cave, only adult ever collected</p>
<p>Hedin: If a species is not real, we don't want to waste scarce conservation resources to preserve it</p>
<p>Hedin: I'm going to argue that some species delimitations may be more important than others</p>
<p><b>Next: Marshall Hedin</b>, Species delimitation in blind cave spiders in Texas</p>
<p>DiDomenico: cryptic sp formerly in S. peacheyi now S. briggsi in honor of Thomas Briggs for his dedication to opilionids</p>
<p>DiDomenico: another n sp named S. starretti in honor of Jim Starrett, who collected the first opilionid from this area</p>
<p>DiDomenico: specimen from Santa Ynez will be named S. ubicki in honor of Darrell Ubick</p>
<p>DiDomenico: Bayes Factor analysis delimited 13 spp, BP&P delimited 11-12 in S. sura group - 5 new ones she will describe</p>
<p>DiDomenico: Genetic data are well suited for species delimitation in morpho cryptic species</p>
<p><b>Next: Angela DiDomenica</b>, Genus tree inference, genetic species delimitation & species descrip in opilionid Sitalcina sura group</p>
<p>Emata: ~8mya was xeric shift in Calif that created barriers to dispersion</p>
<p>Emata: est age of splits suggest Calicina taxa were present on Calif coast were present before formation of coastal valley</p>
<p>Emata: at 35mya, origin of lineage still v uncertain; major lineages in Calicina much more widespread</p>
<p>Emata: How did paedomorphy - retention of juvenile characters by the adult - in Calina develop, and when?</p>
<p>Emata: 4 well-recognized lineages of opilionids, Calicina is in Phalangodidae</p>
<p><b>Next: Kristen Emata</b>, Molecular systematics, historical biogeograph & paedomorphic evolution of the harvestman genus Calicina</p>
<p>Carlson: congeneric pair strategy is very powerful. Use of next-generation sequencing in spiders is just beginning</p>
<p><b>Next: Dave Carlson</b>, de novo assembly, characterization & comparative analysis of entelegyne spiders</p>
<p>Graham: taxa persisted in previously recognized Pleicstocen erefugia </p>
<p>Graham: we have microallopatry - big diffs w/in small geo spaces - but not pre-Pleistocene divergence</p>
<p>Graham: subspecies were not monophyletic, but have some strongly supported lineages</p>
<p>Graham: these deserts are testing grounds for reconstructing biotic assembly</p>
<p><b>Next: Matthew Graham</b>, Phylogeography of large but little known scorpion from Mojave & Sonoran deserts</p>
<p>Bond: In our analysis, orbicularia not monophyletic, uloborids are sister to RTA clade</p>
<p>Bond: We present the first phylogenomic analysis of all spider lineages, based on transcriptome data comprising 327 loci</p>
<p>Bond: & in recent molecular work, some support for it, but weak</p>
<p>Bond: In Blackledge et al.'s work, it might look like morphology has rescued the monophyly of the orbicularia</op>
<p>Bond: We've had the idea that morphology isn't that informative...</p>
<p><b>First talk: Jason Bond</b> on spider phylogenomics: history of Earth's most diverse predator lineage & orb web origins</p>
<p>The first session will be Systematics & Evolution, moderated by Brian Patrick</p>
<p>Dr William MacDonald, dean & director of OSU at Newark is giving a welcome...</p>
