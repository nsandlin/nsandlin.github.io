<h3>Saturday, June 20</h3>
<p>About to get started! 39th annual meeting of the American Arachnological Society June 19–23, 2015</p>
<p>Opening remarks by Dakota Wesleyan Dr. Rocky Von Eye #arachnids15 she's a statistician, but not afraid of spiders. Yay!</p>
<p>The campus of Dakota Wesleyan has at least three fountains
<a href="images/AAS15-DakotaWesleyan.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/AAS15-DakotaWesleyan.jpg" title="click to enlarge"></a></p>
<p>The first session will be Systematics & Evolution (Part 1) #arachnids15 moderator Hanna Wood</p>
<p>Dear friends & colleagues, please join in with comments - & questions for the speakers - at #arachnids15</p>
<p><b>First up: Lauren Esposito</b> on systematics of #scorpions in buthid subfamily Rhopalurusinae</p>
<p>Esposito: New World buthids are monophyletic; also v venomous, 1-k deaths/year</p>
<p>Esposito: the stridulating club-tailed #scorpions Rhopalurus had differences in the stridulatory mechanism; 2 have lost it</p>
<p>Esposito: date of separation of N/S America from Antilles = 35.6my; matches a proposed land bridge GAARlandia</p>
<p><b>Next: James Starrett</b>, with a revision of the #opilionid genus Cryptomaster</p>
<p>Starrett: Short-range endemism is a major focus of Marshall Hedin's lab</p>
<p>Starrett: Sampling in Oregon. Mitochondrial locus showed a deep genetic break along geographic lines</p>
<p>Starrett: ... within Cryptomaster leviathan, despite v similar male reproductive anatomy</p>
<p>Starrett: male reproductive anatomy may underestimate species divergence in arachnids</p>
<p>Side picked! Spiders are fab! ;-) RT Mike Primavera <a href="http:/twitter.com/rimawesome" target="_blank">@primawesome</a> I don't trust you if you aren't scared of spiders. Pick a side.</p>
<p><b>Next: Sam Evans</b> with a genome-wide phylogeny of the jumping spiders, family Salticidae</p>
<p>Evans: Trying to shore up the backbone of Maddison et al. 2014 phylogenetic tree</p>
<p>Evans: don't need to design primers since probe kit for spiders exists (Hamilton et al.)</p>
<p>Evans: results v close to 2014 tree; a different basal salticid tho; Saltafresia are a clade</p>
<p><b>Next: Bob Kallal</b> gives a preliminary look at his revision of the Australian leaf-curling orb-weavers Phonognatha & Deliochus</p>
<p>Kallal: Phonognatha mostly found on east coast, possibly an artifact of collection; some spp in New Caledonia, 1 on west coast</p>
<p>Kallal: Prefer leaves but esp in urban environment will use shells, newspapers, cig butts etc. Male lives in retreat w female</p>
<p>Kallal: Originally they were placed with the nephilines, due to leaving the non-sticky web spiral in place</p>
<p>Kallal: his work places them with zigiellines, along with Deliochus, with good support</p>
<p><b>Next: Marshall Hedin</b> on the many putative cryptic species in a radiation of endemic Californian nemesiid mygalomorphs</p>
<p>Hedin: California nemesiids are not Brachythele & we consider them as belonging to genus Calisoga</p>
<p>Hedin: mtDNA barcoding returned rampant speciation; a pattern of allo/parapatry</p>
<p>Hedin: but there were was v little evidence of speciation morphologically, so looked at nuclear genes...</p>
<p>Hedin: which seemed to confirm multiple species; and in sympatry there was no evidence of gene flow</p>
<p><b>Last up: Wayne Maddison</b> on the phylogenetic resolution of Habronattus jumping spiders using transcriptomes</p>
<p>Maddison: the 100 or so Habronattus species are notable for their complex & colourful courtship displays</p>
<p>Maddison: the Habronattus genome is about twice the size of the human genome, so used transcriptomes</p>
<p>Maddison: almost the same phylogeny was recovered with various subsets, with good robust support</p>
<p>Maddison: had some evidence of introgression in the clypeatus group, but a weak signal</p>
<p>After the break: Ecology with moderator Pamela Sobel-Thropp</p>
<p><b>First up in the Ecology session: Michael Draney</b> on the apparent local extinction of a new population of a non-native spider</p>
<p>Draney: Clubiona pallidula is a Eurasian sac spider never before reported in the Great Lakes</p>
<p>Draney: C. pallidula was found in a 2002 survey of arthropods in the invasive common reed Phragmites</p>
<p>Draney: it was the most common spider found in the Phragmites (none found in the cattails sampling)</p>
<p>Draney: sampling Phragmites sites, incl original sites, in 2010. Found 1k spiders, 86 species</p>
<p>Draney: lycosids & tetragnathids were most common; linyphiids most diverse. Had 139 county records & 8 state records</p>
<p>Draney: Clubiona was v abundant, but found zero C. pallidula</p>
<p>Draney: the winter before we found C. pallidula was the warmest in Green Bay history; but it's known from Russian far north...</p>
<p>Draney: local extinctions of non-natives are probably quite common, but I couldn't find any examples in the literature</p>
<p><b>Next: Sarah Rose</b> on short-term impacts of prescribed burning on the spider community in a small Ohio prairie</p>
<p>Rose: studies of spiders after grassland burns suggest short-term fall in diversity; but they're mostly sweepnet studies</p>
<p>Rose: we re-installed our traps the day after the burn; sampled 4 weeks pre-burn 6 six weeks post-burn</p>
<p>Rose: basically had v little difference in spider abundance & abundance in our pitfall traps pre- & post-burn</p>
<p>Rose: and we saw a variety of anecdotal evidence that some spiders actually survive the burn</p>
<p><b>Next: Kelton Welch</b> with a presentation entitled The ecology of RNAi: what do spiders have to do with it?</p>
<p>Welch: ecological risk assessment: Hazard x Exposure = Ecologicial Risk; they use a tiered process</p>
<p>Welch: RNA interference "We're not just building a product that kills a bug, but one that messes with the genes of an animal"</p>
<p>Welch: "I coined the term RNA Armageddon, but I don't relly believe RNA is going to destroy the world"</p>
<p>Welch: Monsanto stresses that insects don't have RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, but spiders, ticks & mites DO have RdRp’s</p>
<p>Welch: used gut content analysis to see what arachnids had corn products in their guts & looked at their food-chain role</p>
<p><b>Next: Rick Vetter</b> asks Do spiders transmit bacteria when they bite? The evidence suggests otherwise, he says</p>
<p>Vetter: "Spiders live in dirty icky places, eat dirty icky insects like flies who eat poop, right"</p>
<p>Vetter: some recent studies swabbing spider mouthparts have suggested bacteria transmission</p>
<p>Vetter: so he did some data mining across many studies of many spider bites, looking for any mention of infection</p>
<p>Vetter: presence of pus is actually considered a negative indication for a brown recluse bite</p>
<p>Vetter: in fact, there is research being done suggesting that spider venom KILLS bacteria</p>
<p><b>Next: Thomas Jones</b> on boom-bust colony dynamics in the socially polymorphic theridiid spider Anelosimus studiosus</p>
<p>Jones: A. studiosus is an arboreal cobweb weaver common along waterways in the southeastern US</p>
<p>Jones: there is an advantage to being social in cooler climates & in smaller colonies; bigger groups compete for resources</p>
<p>Jones: using agent-based modeling to study the sociality threshold</p>
<p>Jones: colonies seem to be very sensitive to winter severity; larger colonies survive winter better</p>
<p>Jones: the populations are dynamic, with unpredictable boom & crash of colonies</p>
<p>And #arachnids15 will be back after lunch, with the first Behavior session</p>
<p>There are only 4 talks in the #arachnids15 afternoon session on Behavior, moderated by Michael Brewer. The next session is tomorrow morning</p>
<p><b>First up in Behavior: Shawn Wilder</b> on how microcronutrient consumption by female Argiope bruennichi affects offspring survival</p>
<p>Wilder: I'm interested in sexual cannibalism & why do spidrs do it: sexual selection, competition, foraging?</p>
<p>Wilder: some studies have shown that females who cannibalize have more successful hatching & offspring survival</p>
<p>Wilder: some studies have shown that females who cannibalize have more successful hatching & offspring survival</p>
<p>Watching Wilder's stunning video of a female A. bruennichi starting on cannibalistic silk-wrapping even as male is still mating</p>
<p>Wilder: studies have shown that females won't eat the male if not hungry btw, even if he springs into her jaws (as some do)</p>
<p>Wilder: wanted to see if eating the male imparted essential nutrients to the female & her offspring</p>
<p>Wilder: wanted to see if eating the male imparted essential nutrients to the female & her offspring</p>
<p>Wilder: did not see big difference in lab betweem success of cannibals & non among A. bruennichi</p>
<p>Wilder: but micronutrients were important to females, so possibly males in the wild w a varied diet supply those</p>
<p><b>Next: Drew Hataway</b> on submersion tolerance of the coastal dune-dwelling wolf spider Arctosa sanctaerosae</p>
<p>_Wilder: these spiders have their burrows periodically submerged in storm surges during hurricanes</p>
<p>_Wilder: they submerged 89 individuals for 4 hours, 94% were unresponsive, but 36% of those returned to activity</p>
<p>_Wilder: this is being called "hypoxic coma"</p>
<p>_Wilder: we've tried w forest lycosids like Pardosa etc & none of those survive drowning like shore-dwelling Arctosa</p>
<p><b>Next: Paula Cushing</b> with a new species of myrmecophilic spiders from Big Bend, Texas</p>
<p>Cushing: this spider was collected near & inside nests of the seed harvesting ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus</p>
<p>Cushing: they mature in late summer; we don't know what family they belong in</p>
<p><b>Next, last talk of the day: Kerri Wrinn</b> on the effects of autotomy on male-female interactions in Pholcus phalangioides</p>
<p>PS from Cushing: also found staphylinids & silverfish, both common myrmecophiles, in the ant nests</p>
<p>Back to Wrinn: cellar spiders are often nliving in close proximity to one another, often as male-female pairs</p>
<p>Wrinn: 47% of the spiders collected in cellars were in pairs; 18% were missing a leg; only 4.5% were in a pair & missing a leg</p>
<p>Watching Wrinn's video of P. phalangioides leg-tapping courtship, w successful mating & not so much (leg loss)</p>
<p>Wrinn: females missing a leg were more aggressive</p>
<p>Wrinn: but overall there were more positive interactions than negative in all pairings</p>
<p>Tomorrow at 9: 2nd Systematics & Evolution session ... followed by Taxonomy & Diversity, including {{quick horn toot}} my talk on LinEpig</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mitchell's claim to fame - the Corn Palace. It has big outdoor murals made out of ears of corn, and has been a thing for many decades <br>

<h3>Sunday, June 21</h3>
<p>Good morning, #arachnids15 is back in session, with part 2 of Systenatics & Evolution, moderated by Michael Draney</p>
<p><b>First up: Hannah Wood</b> with Need for speed: extremely rapid predatory strikes evolved repeatedly in trap-jaw spiders</p>
<p>Wood: spiders in Mecysmaucheniidae have domed heads & greatly modified long chelicerae, which snap together at great speeds</p>
<p>Wood: it's hard for small organisms to make fast movements; a compensating mechanism is "power amplification"</p>
<p>Wood: photographed the jaw motion at speeds of 30,000 frames/second. We saw this video!</p>
<p>Wood: the fastest species attained peak speeds of 26.5 m/s in less than 0.18 milliseconds</p>
<p>Wood: the phylogeny showed the power morphology to do this evolved 4 separate times</p>
<p>Wood: this is the 1st discovery in arachnids of power amplification mechanisms</p>
<p><b>Next up: Paul Selden</b> on ancient spiders in salt lakes</p>
<p>Selden: the Green River formation is the largest great lake formation in the fossil record; the biota is v diverse</p>
<p>Selden: until recently, only a single specimen (Linyphia byrami Cockerell, 1925) had been described</p>
<p>Selden: now spiders from the families Uloboridae, Hersiliidae, Selenopidae & Thomisidae described</p>
<p>Selden: also seeing some spider fossils from the Florissant formation & Crato in Brazil</p>
<p>Selden: in Crato spider fossils have legs curled up, like "dead on the carpet"</p>
<p>Selden: spider fossils from the other 2 places have legs stretched out like they died on the water</p>
<p>Selden: conjectured this reflected the level of salinity in the water; Crato also had fish mass die-offs</p>
<p>Selden: this was supported w some spider-drowning experiments in different salinity levels</p>
<p>Selden: thus fossil spider leg flexure can serve as a proxy for the paleosalinity of ancient lakes</p>
<p><b>Next: Michael Brewer</b> on the potential dual roles of venom evolution in the genus Tetragnatha</p>
<p>Brewer: spider genomics is burgeoning. They have large genomes for arthropods, but they are hard to assemble</p>
<p>Brewer: so for looking at diversification in species radiation in Hawaii decided to use venom</p>
<p>Brewer: of 114 down-regulated genes, only 3 were homologous to known spider toxins (& they are known to be antimicrobial!)</p>
<p>Brewer: matched up transcriptomes w proteomes looking for venom dimorphisms... & mate recognition</p>
<p>Brewer: ... given the unusual mating behavior (cheliceral locking) in many tetragnathids</p>
<p><b>Next up: Ingi Agnarsson</b> on CarBio, whichs aims to do comparative biogeography of two 'widespread species' in the Caribbean</p>
<p>Agnarsson: interested in developing & testing an index of dispersal ability over geo time among different taxa</p>
<p>Agnarsson: comparing dispersal events of Argiope argentata & Spintharus flavidus, & GAARlandia vs overwater hypothesis</p>
<p>Agnarsson: Argiope is widespread; Spintharus, the poorer disperser, represents an ancient & previously undocumented radiation</p>
<p><b>Next: Greta Binford</b> on ancient colonization of N America via the Caribbean by recluse spiders & evidence for cryptic radiation</p>
<p>Binford: this is another Team CarBio project... There are 6 described Caribbean Loxosceles & 43 in N & Central America</p>
<p>Binford: Loxosceles is a mid-level disperser; oldest common ancestor lived in western Gondwana</p>
<p>Binford: Does monophyly of N Am + Caribbean hold up? Yes. Does radiation reflect geographic history?...</p>
<p>And that's it for Systematics & Evolution talks at #arachnids15 ... after the break, Taxonomy & Diversity. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>This is the #arachnids15 Taxonomy & Diversity session, moderated by Shawn Wilder</p>
<p><b>First up, Sandra Brantley</b> on 4 families of spiders in adjacent conifer forest sites in northern New Mexico</p>
<p>Brantley: ... or how to get around frustrations in spider ecology</p>
<p>Brantley: worked at Valles Caldera National Preserve since 2011 & adjacent Bandelier National Monument for almost 20 years</p>
<p>Brantley: many species from Caldera I'd never collected from Bandelier, altho habitats are similar: mostly conifer 2500-2700m</p>
<p>Brantley: habitat specificity ranged from the greatest in Linyphiidae & Thomisidae, followed by Gnaphosidae</p>
<p>Brantley: longitudinally a lot of variation in abundance year to year in Bandolier, with rel low counts being common</p>
<p>Brantley: discussion of the value of databases in such work; they use SCAN, which has useful mapping functions</p>
<p>Brantley: can use the data for niche modeling together with climate data & identify what will be suitable-habitat predictions</p>
<p>Brantley: so get your specimens databased "Let us work to overcome the phrase 'Known only from the type locality'!"</p>
<p>Binford: & we see different genetic structure across short geo distances among cave populations</p>
<p>Binford: taxa within Caribbean islands are not monophyletic... but 28 mya Cuba was a series of different islands</p>
<p><b>Next: Mia Spaid</b> on spiders of the Everglades National Park: changes in species composition</p>
<p>Spaid: the Everglades is right on the border of biogeographic areas; they looked at 4 habitats</p>
<p>Spaid: the Everglades are much reduced from their original extent, & w v different water flow due to diverting by man</p>
<p>Spaid: was able to use the Jim Berry collection from the late 1960s, & compare to recently collected material</p>
<p>Spaid: hardwood hammock habitat was the most diverse, followed by pinelands, then sawgrass, & willowhead last</p>
<p>Spaid: the greater diversity in 2000 vs 1960s may be largely accounted for by collection differences</p>
<p>Spaid: faunal-community structure was v different between the 2 collection periods & among the 4 habitats</p>
<p><b>Next: Marc Milne</b> with a new species of Liocranoides (Tengellidae) from Alabama</p>
<p>Milne: this study began, like so many do, with rumors of rare spiders, in some cave</p>
<p>Milne: Anvil Cave is a "maze cave" w almost 13 miles of passageways; entrance reached via canoe trip</p>
<p>Milne: Ingram Cave is just a hole in the ground, which opens up into a big room</p>
<p>Milne: saw some troglobitic fauna, altho did not find the rumored rare spiders, but ...</p>
<p>Milne: discovered a cohabiting male & female Liocranoides in Ingram Cave</p>
<p>Milne: Liocranoides Keyserling 1881, btw, contains 5 species of mostly cave-dwelling, medium-sized spiders</p>
<p>The last presentation of this session will be my talk on LinEpig & online taxonomic reference resources...</p>
<p></p>
<p>We're about to start the 2nd Behavior session at #arachnids15, moderated by Kelton Welch</p>
<p><b>First up, Jonathan Coddington</b>, a last-minute addition to the lineup because the planned talk by George Uetz fell through</p>
<p>Jon Coddington is talking about the biodiversity of life on Earth. He leads the Global Genome Initiative #arachnic</p>
<p>Coddington: Remember there is really only one genome</p>
<p>Coddington: "For protein-coded genes, we are only about 50% different from a banana"</p>
<p>Coddington: There are about 10,000 total families of life on earth</p>
<p>Coddington: the best-known families of life on earth, based on online data, are plants & a minnow family</p>
<p>Coddington: ... and just lots of interesting info from the Global Genome Biodiverstiy Network</p>
<p><b>Next: Rachael Mallis</b> on the courtship in Tengella perfuga, w all that strumming, stroking & stilting</p>
<p>Mallis: male courtship - preening & grooming, abdomen shaking, stroking, & "stilting" up on his long legs & silking over her</p>
<p>Mallis: the deed itself is v quick - and then you get a big egg sac w "a thousand babies"</p>
<p>Btw, in Mallis' video, the male's stroking was v focused, & the female proved quite eager</p>
<p><b>Next: Colton Watts</b> on diel patterns of courtship in the subsocial spider Anelosimus studiosus...</p>
<p>Watts: ...& how they may not be driven by female aggression</p>
<p>Watts: A. studiosus males prefer to court docile females; & females have diel patterns of aggression</p>
<p>Watts: used half-light to mimic dawn & dusk; looked at females from single-female & multi-female webs separately</p>
<p>Watts: male courtship did vary w time of day, but only w females from multi-female webs</p>
<p>Watts: clock shifted females from multi-female webs were less aggressive toward prey at dusk</p>
<p>Watts: but males treated clock-shifted females differently than clock-normal females</p>
<p>Watts: those females were more aggressive; clock-shifting can have a wholesale effect on behavior</p>
<p>Watts: clock-shifting probably really stresses them out, so what we had was jet-lagged spiders</p>
<p><b>Next: Anne Danielson-Francois</b> with evidence for sexual selection on spider fangs and behavioral cost</p>
<p>Danielson-Francois: males of the long-jawed orb-weaver Tetragnatha elongata live about as long as females do & eat</p>
<p>Danielson-Francois: but the male's chelicerae & fangs are subtly but definitely different from female's</p>
<p>Danielson-Francois: is natural or sexual selection fashioning the more delicate but longer fangs of the males?</p>
<p>Danielson-Francois: 24-hr fly-catching efficiency is lower for adult T. elongatga males than for females</p>
<p>Danielson-Francois: after mating, males like to steal the female's food item</p>
<p>That was the last talk #arachnids15 of the day. After thebreak, we will go to the poster session</p>

<h3>Monday, June 22</h3>
<p>Good morning from #arachnids15. Getting a late start, as a storm knocked out Internet here...</p>
<p>This session is Webs & Silk, moderated by Sandra Brantley</p>
<p><b>1st: Brent Opell</b> on evolutionary & environmental plasticity in the material properties of orb-weaving spider glue droplets</p>
<p>Opell: Glue droplets in web viscous capture thread differ in hygroscopicity, adapting to habitat humidity</p>
<p>Opell: glycoprotein material properties can vary 630-fold in toughness across the 3 species studied</p>
<p>Opell: and can vary 2- or 3-fold within a species depending on the ambient humidity</p>
<p><b>Next: Sean Blamires</b> on property variation in spider silks: ecology, evolution & biomimic implications</p>
<p>Blamires: major ampullate silk aka dragline silk is the spider silk studied for its high strength properties</p>
<p>Blamires: silk production sequence step 1 protein secrection; protein mix determines strenght vs extensibility</p>
<p>Blamires: post-secretion step 2 = crystalline structure</p>
<p>Blamires: step 3 involves effect of exposure to water (humidity) & wind</p>
<p>Blamires: amorphous alignment had the greatest influence on material properties of the silk</p>
<p><b>Next up: Sarah Stellwagen</b> on intra-orb-web capture spiral adhesive droplet distributions</p>
<p>Stellwagen: a triad of spigots on the posterior lateral spinneret make the sticky threads in an orb web</p>
<p>Stellwagen: Brent Opell had noticed a difference in stickiness between top & bottom as well as outside vs. inside of webs</p>
<p>Stellwagen: collected fresh webs in the morning to measure properties of droplets from different parts of the web</p>
<p>Stellwagen: as in Brent's work, I use angle formed when pulling on droplet to calculate Young's Modulus (measure of toughness)</p>
<p>Stellwagen: spiders run down in the web more easily than up, & they fill in the bottom first</p>
<p>Stellwagen: droplets at the bottom of the web are larger & extend for twice the length of time in the lab</p>
<p>Stellwagen: there is a 44% difference in toughness of the droplets between v top & v bottom of the same web</p>
<p><b>Next: Milan Rez&aacute;  c</b> asks, Do the proportions of the spinning duct influence the material properties of major ampullate fibers?</p>
<p>Rez&aacute;  c: the toughest dragline silk known is produced by the orb weaver Caeostris darwini from Madagscar</p>
<p>Rez&aacute;  c: the spinning duct has an S-shaped curve; silk passing thru it is elongated by shear forces</p>
<p>Rez&aacute;  c: comparing stress-strain curves & length/width measures of each leg of the duct in several species...</p>
<p>Rez&aacute;  c: we found counsiderable variation between species in the length of the loop or curve of the duct</p>
<p>Rez&aacute;  c: toughness significantly correlated w duct width</p>
<p>Rez&aacute;  c: duct length increase out of proportion to spider body size across species</p>
<p>Rez&aacute;  c: larger spiders produce stronger & tougher fibers, likely due to the elongation of spinning ducts</p>
<p>That was it for this year's scientific talks</p>
